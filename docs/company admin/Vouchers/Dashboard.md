##### **1. Key Voucher Statistics**

- **Total Issued**  
    The total value of all vouchers distributed to employees.
    
- **Total Used**  
    How much employees have spent so far.
    
- **Remaining**  
    The total unused voucher amount left across the company.
    
- **Returned**  
    Vouchers that employees have returned (if any).
    

##### **2. Voucher Status Summary**

- **Active** – Vouchers that are still valid and can be used.
    
- **Partially Used** – Vouchers that employees have used partially.
    
- **Exhausted** – Vouchers that have been fully used.
    
- **Returned** – Vouchers employees sent back voluntarily or after expiry.
    

##### **3. User-wise Consumption Table**

This section shows voucher usage for each employee:

- **Issued** – Total voucher amount given to the employee.
    
- **Used** – Amount the employee has spent.
    
- **Remaining** – Balance left for that employee.
    
- **Usage %** – A visual indicator of how much of their voucher amount has been consumed.
    

This helps admins quickly identify:

- Who has fully used their vouchers
    
- Who still has balance left
    
- Who may need more vouchers
    
- Any unusual usage patterns
