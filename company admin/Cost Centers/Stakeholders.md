On the left menu, under **Cost Centres**, you will see **Stakeholders**.  
Clicking on it opens the project management page.

![[nexpense_company_cost_center_stakeholders_v1.png|205]]

This section allows company admins to manage the people involved in projects and cost centres.

This includes:

- Adding new stakeholders
    
- Assigning them to specific projects
    
- Managing their roles and visibility
    
- Updating or removing existing stakeholders
    

Use this section whenever you need to control **who can access and manage a project**.

At the top, you will see a list of all active projects.  
Click on any project (e.g., **Employee Wellness Program**) to open its stakeholder settings.

You can choose who can view the project:

- **Private** – Only assigned stakeholders can access the project
