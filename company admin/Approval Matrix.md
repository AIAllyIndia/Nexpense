The **Workflow Builder** allows company admins to design a custom approval flow for reports.  
You can add one or multiple approval levels and decide **who approves**, **when they approve**, and **under what conditions**.

#### **What You Can Do Here**

- **Create approval levels** (Level 1, Level 2, Level 3, etc.)
    
- **Choose approval type** — such as sequential approvals.
    
- **Assign approver roles** for each level.
    
- **Add conditions** (like amount limits or categories) to trigger specific approval steps.
    
- **Add more approval steps** to build multi-level workflows.
    
- **Save the entire workflow** once all steps are configured.
    

#### **Purpose**

This tool helps ensure reports go through the right people before they are finalized, improving control, transparency, and compliance within the company.

### **Approval Types**
Approvals happen **one after another** in a fixed order. Each level must approve before the next level starts.

 **1. Sequential Approval (One-by-One)**: In **Sequential** approval, approvers review the report **one after another**, in a fixed order.

- Level 1 approves → then Level 2 → then Level 3
    
- The next level starts **only after** the previous level approves
    
- Best for **strict workflows** and **hierarchy-based approvals**
    
**Example:**  
Business Head approves → then Accountant approves → then Finance Manager approves

**2. Parallel Approval (All at the Same Time)**: In **Parallel** approval, all assigned approvers get the request **at the same time**.

- Approvers act **independently, in parallel**
    
- The report is approved only when **all required approvers** respond
    
- Best for **speed**, **collaboration**, or when hierarchy is not required

##### Parallel Approval Requirements
1. **Any one approves**: The report is approved as soon as **any one approver** in this level approves it. Faster approval.

2. **Everyone must approve**: **All approvers** in this level must approve the report. Approval moves forward only when everyone agrees.

**Example:**  
Business Head, HR, and Finance team all receive the report together.
